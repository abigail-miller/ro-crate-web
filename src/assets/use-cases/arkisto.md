The basis of Arkisto is that the long-term preservability of well-described data is always the first consideration.
Data on an Arkisto deployment is alway available on disc (or object storage) with a complete description independently of any services such as websites or APIs. Once the data is safe and well described, Arkisto has a flexible model for how data can be accessed using a variety of services.
Arkisto is built on top of Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) and the Oxford Common File System Layout (OCFL).
With Arkisto there is no messy data migration.
